In engineering, if you don’t know what you’re doing, you shouldn’t be doing it.” — Richard Hamming</strong></blockquote><p name="706c" id="706c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">This quote resonates deeply with me. I’ve spent much of my career chasing the unknowns, and that pursuit still gives me an adrenaline rush. But in today’s AI-first world, the line between science and engineering is increasingly blurred. Success in one often depends on fluency in the other. I think of this as a continuum. Most AI roles oscillate along this axis. I am calling this “The AI roles continuum”.</p><p name="b2b5" id="b2b5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">All of engineering involves some creativity to cover the parts not known, and almost all of science includes some practical engineering to translate the abstractions into practice. Much of present science rests on engineering tools, and as time goes on, engineering seems to involve more and more of the science part.</p><p name="36e1" id="36e1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In today’s AI landscape, impactful applications require scientists to think like systems engineers — fluent in distributed training, memory optimization, and parallelism — while engineers must understand the foundations of modern architectures, data scaling, and training dynamics. Much of OpenAI’s breakthrough with GPT models stems from researchers like Alec Radford who could think like engineers — scaling models beyond single-GPU limits to train billion-parameter systems. This fusion of science and engineering unlocked emergent behaviors that define today’s LLMs.</p><p name="08e3" id="08e3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’d love to hear how others relate to this.
