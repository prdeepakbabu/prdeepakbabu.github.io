<p>Informatica recently unvieled its latest release informatica 9 with some major enhancements as compared to its earlier versions, believed to revolutionize data integration &amp;  ETL market. I know lot of my friends hunting for informatica jobs. I have tried to compile all the informatica interview questions available from geekinterview.com into a single pdf document. I hope this greatly saves time as navigating from one question page to another page often consumed lots of our time. Please note that the data available in the document is &#8220;as-is&#8221; available in geekinterview.com.<br />
