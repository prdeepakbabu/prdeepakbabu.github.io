<p>Turning raw data into insights often involves integrating data from multiple disparate sources (not just limited structured one), analyzing the data, visualizing it and socializing the results/insights to a broader audience to whom the results are of interest. In this cycle of turning data into insights, Visualization plays a vital role and hence would be the topic of my discussion in this blog post . Visualization could aid in analyzing huge data by identifying patterns which are easily interpretable visually as compared to tabular layout of numbers.Second, Visualization could help  represent the numbers using visuals which are easy for everyone to read and understand. One could easily convey the insights of the analysis by visuals, grasped in a minute or two, which might have possibly took 3-4 mins using textual aid/table of numbers.This is a important factor to consider especially when are you delivering the findings to the CEO/CFO/CXO/CIO of a company, as often they have limited time.</p>

<p>Going back to history of visualization. The most famous, early example mapping epidemiological data was Dr. John Snow&#8217;s map of deaths from a cholera outbreak in London, 1854, in relation to the locations of public water pumps. The original (<a href="http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/highressnowmap.html">high-res PDF copies from UCLA</a>), spawned many imitators including this simplified version by Gilbert in 1958. Tufte (1983, p. 24) says,&#8221;Snow observed that cholera occurred almost entirely among those who lived near (and drank from) the Broad Street water pump. He had the handle of the contaminated pump removed, ending the neighborhood epidemic which had taken more than 500 lives.&#8221;<span id="more-381"></span><br />
The following pointers should help anyone analyze data and socialize finding by effective newer visualizations techniques:</p>
