<section name="6ee3" class="section section--body section--first"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="9282" id="9282" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">As an AI scientist who has been immersed in the field for many years, I’ve witnessed firsthand the grassroots innovations that have propelled artificial intelligence forward — be it large language models (LLMs), transfer learning, deep learning, self-supervised learning, or model distillation techniques. While I’ve been well-versed in the technical advancements, I’ve often found myself contemplating their broader economic impact and implications for industry. In recent months, I’ve delved into various State of AI reports from venture capital firms specializing in AI investments. One such report that caught my attention was <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/generative-ai-act-two/" data-href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/generative-ai-act-two/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sequoia Capital’s analysis</a> on the evolving landscape of AI. Here is my attempt to summarize their insights and add my own perspective.</p><p name="4580" id="4580" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Throughout history, technological revolutions have not only introduced new tools but have fundamentally transformed how we live, work, and interact. The shift from on-premise systems to cloud computing, and from desktop to mobile devices, didn’t just change our gadgets — they redefined entire industries and altered the trajectory of innovation. Today, we stand on the cusp of another seismic shift - the rise of artificial general intelligence (AGI). By examining past revolutions, we can glean insights into AI’s potential impact and understand where the most significant opportunities lie.</p><figure name="ac37" id="ac37" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3NBiXkB0D_M?feature=oembed" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure><p name="24c2" id="24c2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">I. Lessons from Past Technological Revolutions and Their Implications for AI</strong></p><figure name="c482" id="c482" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*79ngCNBI0F6jBPa86raHmA.png" data-width="973" data-height="241" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*79ngCNBI0F6jBPa86raHmA.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Technological Revolutions &amp; Its Impact — shows the impact of moving from onprem software to cloud software (SaaS)</figcaption></figure><p name="431d" id="431d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The transition from on-premise computing to the cloud marked a pivotal moment in technology. On-premise systems required substantial capital investment, physical infrastructure, and dedicated maintenance teams. They were often inflexible and couldn’t scale quickly to meet changing demands. The advent of cloud computing disrupted this model entirely. Suddenly, businesses could access scalable, on-demand resources over the internet, paying only for what they used. This democratized access to powerful computing and leveled the playing field for startups and small businesses.<br>Similarly, the move from desktop to mobile computing transformed the way we interact with technology. Mobile devices untethered us from our desks, providing constant connectivity and spawning new industries centered around apps and mobile services. This shift required businesses to rethink user experiences, leading to innovations like touch interfaces and location-based services.<br>These revolutions share common threads: they removed barriers to access, enabled scalability, and required businesses to adapt rapidly or risk obsolescence. For AI, these lessons underscore the importance of flexibility and foresight. Just as cloud computing and mobile technology required new ways of thinking, AI demands that we reimagine processes and strategies to harness its full potential.</p><p name="961f" id="961f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">II. The Critical Role of the Application Layer and the Rise of Vertical AI</strong></p><p name="eb67" id="eb67" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">While foundational AI models and infrastructure capture much of the spotlight, the true innovation and value are being realized at the application layer. This is where AI intersects with real-world problems, translating technological capabilities into tangible solutions.</p><p name="ac66" id="ac66" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The AI technology stack consists of three primary layers:</p><p name="4c02" id="4c02" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">• <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Infrastructure Layer</strong>: Provides the computational power and hardware necessary for AI applications.<br>• <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Model Layer</strong>: Encompasses the algorithms and AI models developed by researchers.<br>• <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Application Layer</strong>: Involves the development of AI-powered applications that solve specific problems for users.</p><p name="979c" id="979c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The application layer is critical because it’s where AI delivers value. It’s not enough to have powerful models; these models must be applied effectively to address specific needs. This is where vertical AI comes into play.</p><figure name="081d" id="081d" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*SLDlbVx4GlIiTd92nVSGXw.png" data-width="811" data-height="446" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*SLDlbVx4GlIiTd92nVSGXw.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Sam Altman advice to startups</figcaption></figure><p name="65e8" id="65e8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Vertical AI</strong> refers to AI applications tailored to specific industries or domains. Unlike general-purpose AI, vertical AI understands the nuances and complexities of a particular field. For example, in healthcare, AI can analyze medical images to detect diseases earlier than human clinicians. In finance, AI algorithms can detect fraudulent transactions with greater accuracy.<br>As Andrew Ng, a pioneer in machine learning, noted, “AI is the new electricity. Just as electricity transformed almost everything 100 years ago, today I have a hard time thinking of an industry that I don’t think AI will transform.”<br><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Vertical AI </strong>is powerful because it integrates domain-specific knowledge with AI capabilities. It addresses unique challenges within industries, leading to more effective solutions. Companies that focus on vertical AI can differentiate themselves by offering specialized services that general AI cannot provide.</p><p name="7c62" id="7c62" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">III. From Software-as-a-Service to Service-as-a-Software</strong></p><p name="22f6" id="22f6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model revolutionized software delivery by allowing users to access applications over the internet without the need for installation or maintenance. This model provided flexibility and reduced costs, but users still had to operate the software to achieve their desired outcomes.</p><p name="da5d" id="da5d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">AI is now pushing us toward a new paradigm: <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Service-as-a-Software</strong>. In this model, AI doesn’t just provide tools — it performs services autonomously. Businesses pay for the results or outcomes, not for the software itself.</p><p name="ca56" id="ca56" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To illustrate, consider a company that needs to analyze vast amounts of legal documents. Under the traditional model, they might purchase software and hire staff to perform the analysis. With SaaS, they could subscribe to a cloud-based platform but still need people to operate it. In the Service-as-a-Software model, they can use an AI service that automatically analyzes the documents and provides insights, paying only for the analysis performed.</p><p name="692e" id="692e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This shift offers several advantages:</p><p name="4238" id="4238" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">• <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Efficiency</strong>: AI services can perform tasks faster and with greater accuracy than humans in many cases.<br>• <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Cost Savings</strong>: Companies pay only for the outcomes, reducing overhead costs associated with staffing and training.<br>• <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Scalability</strong>: Services can be scaled up or down based on demand without significant investments in infrastructure.</p><p name="9c75" id="9c75" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This model also opens new possibilities for startups and entrepreneurs. By focusing on delivering specific services through AI, companies can tap into markets previously dominated by larger organizations with more resources.</p><p name="2471" id="2471" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">IV. The Importance of Reasoning Techniques: Thinking Fast and Slow in AI</strong></p><p name="c534" id="c534" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Advancements in AI are not just about processing power or data volumes — they’re about enhancing the quality of AI’s reasoning. Daniel Kahneman’s concepts of “System 1” and “System 2” thinking, described in his book “Thinking, Fast and Slow,” provide a useful framework.</p><p name="ce6a" id="ce6a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">• <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">System 1 (Fast Thinking)</strong>: This is our brain’s automatic, quick, and intuitive mode. It’s useful for routine tasks and situations requiring immediate responses.<br>• <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">System 2 (Slow Thinking)</strong>: This mode is deliberate and analytical, used for complex problem-solving and critical thinking.</p><p name="97b7" id="97b7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Most AI systems today excel at System 1 thinking. They can recognize patterns, translate languages, and make quick predictions based on learned data. However, they struggle with System 2 tasks that require reasoning, planning, and understanding context.</p><p name="3b16" id="3b16" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Developing AI that can think slowly — engaging in deep reasoning — is crucial for applications where accuracy and reliability are paramount. For instance, in legal analysis, AI must understand nuanced language and interpret laws correctly. In medical diagnostics, it must consider patient history and symptoms to provide accurate assessments.</p><p name="01c3" id="01c3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">OpenAI’s development of models like GPT-4 demonstrates progress in this area. These models use techniques such as chain-of-thought prompting, where the AI generates intermediate reasoning steps before arriving at a conclusion. This allows the AI to tackle more complex tasks by simulating a step-by-step thought process.</p><p name="a223" id="a223" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, emphasized this point: “The power of AI is not in mimicking human behavior but in reasoning through complex problems in ways humans might not.”</p><p name="5fea" id="5fea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Enhancing AI’s reasoning capabilities offers several benefits:</p><p name="2532" id="2532" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">• <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Improved Accuracy</strong>: Better reasoning reduces errors in AI outputs.<br>• <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Greater Trust</strong>: Users are more likely to trust AI systems that can explain their reasoning.<br>• <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Expanded Applications</strong>: AI can be applied to more complex domains, opening new opportunities.</p><p name="cab1" id="cab1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Investing in slow thinking techniques is essential for pushing AI beyond its current limitations and unlocking its full potential.</p><figure name="cfd6" id="cfd6" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DN_ybO7pjm0?feature=oembed" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure><p name="cfca" id="cfca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Conclusion</strong></p><p name="792e" id="792e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The technological revolutions of the past teach us that embracing change is not just advantageous — it’s necessary for survival and growth. The shift from on-premise systems to the cloud and from desktop to mobile computing required businesses to rethink their strategies and adapt quickly. AI presents a similar challenge, but with even broader implications.</p><p name="50a8" id="50a8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The most significant innovations and value in AI are emerging at the application layer, particularly through vertical AI that addresses specific industry needs. By shifting from Software-as-a-Service to Service-as-a-Software, businesses can deliver outcomes more efficiently and cost-effectively.</p><p name="ae09" id="ae09" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Enhancing AI’s reasoning capabilities — teaching machines to think both fast and slow — is critical for tackling complex problems and building trust with users. As AI continues to evolve, these advancements will enable it to contribute meaningfully across various sectors.</p><p name="bbf9" id="bbf9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Embracing AI’s potential requires new ways of thinking and a willingness to adapt. By learning from past revolutions and focusing on innovation at the application layer, we can harness AI to drive progress and create a better world.</p><p name="72cc" id="72cc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Related Content</strong></p><div name="5bdc" id="5bdc" class="graf graf--mixtapeEmbed graf-after--p"><a href="https://medium.com/@prdeepak.babu/the-dawn-of-synthetic-brains-how-large-language-models-are-shaping-ai-agents-640a78f3a830" data-href="https://medium.com/@prdeepak.babu/the-dawn-of-synthetic-brains-how-large-language-models-are-shaping-ai-agents-640a78f3a830" class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" title="https://medium.com/@prdeepak.babu/the-dawn-of-synthetic-brains-how-large-language-models-are-shaping-ai-agents-640a78f3a830"><strong class="markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong">The Dawn of Synthetic Brains: How Large Language Models Are Shaping AI Agents</strong><br><em class="markup--em markup--mixtapeEmbed-em">Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated a significant capability for reasoning and…</em>medium.com</a><a href="https://medium.com/@prdeepak.babu/the-dawn-of-synthetic-brains-how-large-language-models-are-shaping-ai-agents-640a78f3a830" class="js-mixtapeImage mixtapeImage u-ignoreBlock" data-media-id="28eac622b9179426596513720f0d6363" data-thumbnail-img-id="1*T6XlrGGcdwnZTrhPRs3ENA.png" style="background-image: url(https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/160/160/1*T6XlrGGcdwnZTrhPRs3ENA.png);"></a></div><div name="c388" id="c388" class="graf graf--mixtapeEmbed graf-after--mixtapeEmbed graf--trailing"><a href="https://medium.com/@prdeepak.babu/the-rise-of-multimodal-large-speech-language-models-4fc5ea34d04f" data-href="https://medium.com/@prdeepak.babu/the-rise-of-multimodal-large-speech-language-models-4fc5ea34d04f" class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" title="https://medium.com/@prdeepak.babu/the-rise-of-multimodal-large-speech-language-models-4fc5ea34d04f"><strong class="markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong">The Rise of Multimodal Large Speech &amp;
