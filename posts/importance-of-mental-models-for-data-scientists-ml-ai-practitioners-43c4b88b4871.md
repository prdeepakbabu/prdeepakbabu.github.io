<section name="0973" class="section section--body section--first section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="61ee" id="61ee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">We have all been in situations where we have felt a lack of clarity and understanding on a complex project, metrics defined for measurement disagree with customer anecdotes, deploying a solution that does not lead to projected impact, trouble prioritizing experiments that have many levels with high branching factor and ambiguity and similar others. What do all of these have in common ? It is not easy to point to any specific pattern here. Effectively, we are trying to navigate the complexity of the world and trying to separate the signal from noise.</p><figure name="aa2d" id="aa2d" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*9b8lKPdXzXQxWJ_6_aZMKA.png" data-width="1040" data-height="488" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9b8lKPdXzXQxWJ_6_aZMKA.png"></figure><p name="41e8" id="41e8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The focus of this post is mental models and how they can be used in situations like the ones shared here. How could we use mental models strategically to increase the signal-to-noise ratio ? I’m sure many of us are already using some form of mental models in our day-to-day decision making both strategic and short-term, without even being aware of it or are doing this unconciously.</p><p name="fdba" id="fdba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In my 15+ years of data science career, I have had the opportunity of working in diverse science teams from management consulting to technology consulting, unicorn product (niche) startups to large product companies. I see one area that is largely seen as experience-driven learning is “Art of defining the problem”, an often underappreciated area but very important skill to cut the clutter and seperate signal from noise.</p><blockquote name="085e" id="085e" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Solving a problem simply means representing it so as to make the solution transparent — Herbert Simon</blockquote><p name="18a7" id="18a7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Unfortunately, there are no formal courses that teach this in academia or MOOC. Here is my small effort to introduce you to mental models and motivate concious use of these as tools in problem solving. I hope to make a more elaborate course on this topic at some point, possibly as MOOC or a book if there is enough interest.</p><h4 name="906b" id="906b" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Mental Models (MM)</strong></h4><p name="5c87" id="5c87" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_model" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_model" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> defines mental models as</p><blockquote name="2866" id="2866" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--hasDropCapModel graf-after--p">A <strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">mental model</strong> is an explanation of someone’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" title="Thought" rel="noopener" target="_blank">thought</a> process about how something works in the real world. It is a representation of the surrounding world, the relationships between its various parts and a person’s intuitive perception about their own acts and their consequences. Mental models can help shape <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviour" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviour" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" title="Behaviour" rel="noopener" target="_blank">behaviour</a> and set an approach to solving problems (similar to a personal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" title="Algorithm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">algorithm</a>) and doing tasks</blockquote><p name="1527" id="1527" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">A mental model is about forming an opinion about the complex world and being able to navigate around it by breaking complex problems into its component problems that are easier to reason about. They can also be thought as frameworks or mechanisms that help explain the world. As a data scientist approaching a problem, often I use more than one mental model at any time. It is good to have a lattice of mental models to increase the odds of being right. We can think of this lattice as an ensemble of mental models, the more models that agree with your reasoning the more confidence you can have in your approach or solutioning.</p><p name="eff6" id="eff6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the next section, I have picked 4 mental models that I feel is important for DS/ML scientists and do a deep dive on each. In subsequent section, I discuss other mental models that are equally useful without getting into details and reserve them for future posts.</p><h4 name="e06c" id="e06c" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">MM 1: Exploration vs. Exploitation — Innovation</h4><p name="699f" id="699f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">As DS/AI practitioners you might have heard about Explore-exploit, a framework that is at the core of reinforcement learning, a learning framework that improves by interacting with environment. The basic idea being instead of always trying to implement the best-known option, it encourages exploring new routes or options 20% or x% of time to increase the chance of exiting a local optima leading towards a global optima that is better than earlier best-known. Similarly, as data scientists when working on improving AI systems we need to allocate a certain budget (time and effort) for moonshot ideas which may initially look like research but have potential to convert to a promising direction in future. Google formalized this by encouraging employees to dedicate 20% of their time towards personal projects of interest that are beyond their projects (called “20% project”). It fosters innovation and collaboration, some of the popular google features like gmail, google talk and news among others were born out of this initiative.</p><figure name="c084" id="c084" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*ssvuJw9EL_1Ix7g1" data-width="516" data-height="339" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*ssvuJw9EL_1Ix7g1"><figcaption class="imageCaption">visual depecting how exploration leads to increasing chance of converging to global maxima beaking out of local maxima.</figcaption></figure><h4 name="613c" id="613c" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure">MM2 : System 1 vs. System 2 thinking — Efficiency</h4><p name="f3a1" id="f3a1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Daniel Kahenman popularized the concept of system 1 vs. system 2 thinking in his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman-ebook/dp/B00555X8OA" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman-ebook/dp/B00555X8OA" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“Thinking Fast &amp; Slow</em>”</a> to distinguish between low-resistance or low-effort but quick system 1 from often slow but methodical and structured thinking of system 2. It is important to identify system 1 tasks in a project, as it typically involves routine, repitative tasks which needs to be automated or templatized for faster execution. Let’s say you are working on a face recognition project, one of the system 1 tasks might be model debugging where you need to visualize activation maps of pixels that influence a model to classify images into a particular class. This is a repetitive task that needs to be modularized using a function abstracting many sub-tasks in the process so you can be effective at debugging. For the same face recognition project, a system 2 task might be to establish an upper bound performance you can expect for the face recognition model. This would involve thinking from first principles, laying out hypotheses, collecting data and answering component questions. For example, in this case you might want to understand the accuracy of face recognition with respect to humans, as models are often trained using human labeled datasets. If the face recognition model has already caught up to/exceeded human accuracy then it could indicate your direction or approach is limited by the quality of the labeled dataset and hint for datasets that can be created beyond human supervision.</p><figure name="31aa" id="31aa" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*P6787bnD_45q59pv" data-width="485" data-height="306" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*P6787bnD_45q59pv"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Illustration of system1 and system2 tasks</figcaption></figure><h4 name="317a" id="317a" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure">MM3 : First principles thinking — Impact</h4><p name="1307" id="1307" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">First Principles thinking involves building a culture of repeatedly asking “why” to understand a problem until you reach a point where you are unable to break it down any further or you have reached a foundational point. The solutions hypothesized for outer “why” will look very different from the inner “why” and often it is the inner “why” that unlocks maximal impact. I have seen teams which took a problem statement from an outer “why” and worked towards a solution to find it had a negligible impact. The inner why leads to formulating an objective that you want to optimize, that directly addresses the original problem. <br>I find problem definition isn’t given enough importance in most workplaces except maybe management consulting firms. Part of the reason being PS is considered more an art than science. Top management consulting firms like McKinsey, BCG have many decades of experience in studying problems and developed frameworks that guide in effective problem solving. I highly recommend reading the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/McKinsey-Way-Techniques-Strategic-Consultants-ebook/dp/B000FA5KX2/r" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/McKinsey-Way-Techniques-Strategic-Consultants-ebook/dp/B000FA5KX2/r" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">“<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The McKinsey Way</em>”</a> by Ethan M Rasiel which gives a birds eye view of a McKinsey engagement and frameworks/tools used for problem solving throughout an engagement. I wish someday, we could teach our kids such important life skills in schools and colleges. To stresss importance of defining a problem reminds me of following quote from Abraham Lincoln. “<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">If I only had an hour to chop down a tree, I would spend the first 45 minutes sharpening my axe.</strong>” — Abraham Lincoln</p><p name="6a8d" id="6a8d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">There are other closely related mental models related to this like second order effect, thinking hats, what-if, circle of concern/influence, etc. that helps to broaden and build the understanding of problem. I am skipping these for now, to keep this post concise and actionable.</p><h4 name="0cfc" id="0cfc" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">MM4 : Cross Pollination of Ideas — Innovation</h4><figure name="0173" id="0173" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h4"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*9tBGpGC9ec3oPlnmKMbnBA.png" data-width="465" data-height="291" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9tBGpGC9ec3oPlnmKMbnBA.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">How a solved problem from one domain can be adopted to unsolved structurally similar problem in another domain</figcaption></figure><p name="21b8" id="21b8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">what can airlines industry (seat assignment) learn from retail shelf optimization ? Self-supervision was a concept that originated from NLP but was later borrowed in vision and speech as a way to do representation learning. How to about learning from nature ? Did you know an efficient routing algorithm was inspired from ant colonies transporting food from point A to B ? As you can see from these examples, there are so many seemingly disconnected things that have exactly similar underlying problem structures which can be used to cross learn and solve. I am very interested in biomimicry (also called as bioimitation or bioinspirtaion) which deals with study of natural phenomenon to build machines and devices that can mimic this behavior. While this is a field that is nascent &amp; emerging, a recent book by Kristy titled “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Natures-Wild-Ideas-Scientific-Innovation/dp/1771648198" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/Natures-Wild-Ideas-Scientific-Innovation/dp/1771648198" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nature’s Wild Ideas: How the Natural World is Inspiring Scientific Innovation</a>” makes for an interesting read. So I encourage you to read research or ideas from domains very different from your own, there are these interesting cross pollination of ideas that is waiting to happen.</p><h4 name="1abc" id="1abc" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">More Mental Models</h4><ul class="postList"><li name="7c27" id="7c27" class="graf graf--li graf-after--h4"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Second Order Effect </strong>— A consequence of an action taken as a reaction to something.</li><li name="c467" id="c467" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Long tail and Pareto Principle</strong> — A majority of outcome is explained by minority of cause.
