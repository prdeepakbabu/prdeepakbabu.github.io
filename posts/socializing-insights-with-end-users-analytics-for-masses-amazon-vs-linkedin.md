<p>This blog post is about comparison of amazon.com and linkedin.com in terms of similarities across dimensions of analytic maturity &amp; use of data shared by their customers. As Thomas Davenport mentions in his book “Competing with analytics”, amazon.com is one of the few companies which was built on the foundation of data, the so called “Analytically mature” company. LinkedIn has joined the list, with lot of new features available to their users.</p>
<p>As customers interact with the site, they generate data about their liking towards certain products or feature. Companies like amazon.com and LinkedIn clearly understand how to leverage this information to make the interaction between the customer and the site even more valuable &amp; relevant. Users who are ready to share more data with site about their likes/dislikes, the better would be the site’s recommendation for the user.  The companies need to instil this confidence in the customers mind, and hence have the users share data by will.</p>
<p><span id="more-422"></span>              Amazon.com &amp; LinkedIn makes available every little fact about the consumer’s behaviour and interaction with other users or products to help change their behaviour in terms of decision they make to buy or not-buy a product or whether to look for an employer change, etc.</p>
<p>LinkedIn has amazing insights about the companies, profiles which is all available to the users freely. In a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhmKasTiAg">interview with linkedIn CEO, Reid Hoffman</a> by Andreas weigend, Reid talks about every individual as a small business and every individual thinks of their reputation in terms of number of new connections, who viewed their profiles, how many times their profile came up in the search results and stats of similar kind.  <a href="http://www.weigend.com/">Andreas Weigend</a>, a social data expert talks behavior change brought about by features like &#8216;who viewed your profile in the last 15 days&#8217; in end users and in the way companies like LinkedIn treats the users.</p>
<p>(i)                  Insights about companies( lets say we are researching the company mu-sigma):</p>
<ul>
<li>Employee switching patterns between companies. Employees moved from ‘xyz’ to mu-sigma.</li>
<li>Employee switching patterns between companies: Employees  moved from mu-sigma to “abc”.</li>
<li>Gender distribution: M to F ratio at mu-sigma.</li>
<li>By years of experience, how does mu-sigma differ from other companies. Similar statistics is available by job function, educational qualification &amp; university. Similar company benchmark is available for comparison.</li>
<li>People who looked at “mu-sigma” also viewed – other list of companies?</li>
<li>Where employees of mu-sigma call home</li>
<li>Most recommended at mu-sigma.</li>
<li>Time trend of employees who got a change in title.</li>
</ul>
<p>(ii)                Insights about profiles/users</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Who viewed my profile in the last 15 days?</li>
<li>How many times did your profile show up in search results?</li>

<ul>Here’s a look at what amazon.com offers. When purchasing a product at amazon.com, the user would be presented with stats related to</p>
<li>How many users who searched for the book “The outliers by Malcolm Gladwell” (say) ended up purchasing it or ended up purchasing “The tipping Point” , “The Blink” , “What the dog saw”, etc.. in the same order. However I feel the need to quantify the same would help. I mean calling out that 80% of people who searched for “A” ended up purchasing “B”. Or 80% of people who searched for “A” ended up purchasing “A”.</li>
<li>“Frequently brought together items” for a given product.</li>
<li>Review statistics: How many rated 5-star, 4-star and so on, as a bar chart.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are moving towards an era of socializing data with end users to make every little decision they possibly make is data driven. WordPress, Netflix, glassdoor, etc are some of the other companies geared towards this trend. The intention of collecting data has truly gone beyond marketing purpose.</p>
