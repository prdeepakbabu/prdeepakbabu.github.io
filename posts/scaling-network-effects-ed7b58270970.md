Each of these companies faced their own set of demand-side and supply-side scaling issues, providing a rich backdrop for my understanding of startup ecosystems.</p><p name="1280" id="1280" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In his recently published book (2022), <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cold-Start-Problem-Andrew-Chen/dp/0062969749/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_w=1oJF3&amp;content-id=amzn1.sym.5f7e0a27-49c0-47d3-80b2-fd9271d863ca%3Aamzn1.symc.e5c80209-769f-4ade-a325-2eaec14b8e0e&amp;pf_rd_p=5f7e0a27-49c0-47d3-80b2-fd9271d863ca&amp;pf_rd_r=45NS12T1EHJC5AG3PGAJ&amp;pd_rd_wg=Ts1Hs&amp;pd_rd_r=a765d43a-b754-4383-a5fa-bf891d05a0cd&amp;ref_=pd_gw_ci_mcx_mr_hp_atf_m" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/Cold-Start-Problem-Andrew-Chen/dp/0062969749/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_w=1oJF3&amp;content-id=amzn1.sym.5f7e0a27-49c0-47d3-80b2-fd9271d863ca%3Aamzn1.symc.e5c80209-769f-4ade-a325-2eaec14b8e0e&amp;pf_rd_p=5f7e0a27-49c0-47d3-80b2-fd9271d863ca&amp;pf_rd_r=45NS12T1EHJC5AG3PGAJ&amp;pd_rd_wg=Ts1Hs&amp;pd_rd_r=a765d43a-b754-4383-a5fa-bf891d05a0cd&amp;ref_=pd_gw_ci_mcx_mr_hp_atf_m" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">“The Cold Start Problem: How to Start and Scale Network Effects,” </a>Andrew Chen delves deep into the intricacies of scaling a startup from its nascent stages to becoming a tech behemoth. Drawing from real-world examples of tech unicorns like Facebook, Airbnb, and LinkedIn, Chen, a general partner at the renowned venture firm a16z, offers invaluable insights into the science of scaling network-centric startups. I am sharing a few top insights from reading this book, things that resonated the most given my prior experience of working in start-ups.</p><p name="265a" id="265a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Cold Start Conundrum</strong> At the heart of the book lies the concept of the ‘cold start phase.’ Chen emphasizes the significance of constructing atomic networks — focused, small-scale networks that validate and propel an idea by attracting adjacent networks. Take Facebook, for instance. Its initial success was rooted in the closed network of Stanford users, which eventually expanded to other universities. Similarly, Slack’s early traction came from corporations using it to enhance internal communication. This phase often sees founders ‘flintstoning’ — meticulously curating content to bolster the supply side and simultaneously building the demand side to establish a foundational user network. A standout strategy discussed is the “come for the tool, stay for the network” approach, exemplified by Instagram. Initially, users flocked to Instagram for its unique photo filters, but it was the burgeoning network that kept them hooked.</p><figure name="d47f" id="d47f" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*qakauMDn6WTlTonw" data-width="1024" data-height="577" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*qakauMDn6WTlTonw"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Different phases of growth journey of marketplace or company with network effects</figcaption></figure><p name="1953" id="1953" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Growth Trajectory</strong> As startups transition from their cold start, they enter a phase characterized by viral growth. This phase demands innovative marketing strategies, forging partnerships, and global expansion. Chen cites Coca-Cola’s pioneering coupon distribution strategy and Uber’s driver incentives as prime examples of growth-centric tactics. Retaining high-value users while continually expanding the user base becomes paramount. Engagement metrics, whether they’re likes and comments for social networks or visits and purchases for e-commerce platforms, take center stage.</p><p name="394a" id="394a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Navigating Saturation and Building a Moat</strong> Every startup’s growth journey eventually faces the saturation hurdle. After a period of explosive growth, market capture peaks, and growth rates dwindle. Chen elaborates on how giants like eBay and Uber innovated to overcome this plateau. While eBay diversified by introducing fixed-price sales alongside its auction market, Uber ventured into ride-sharing and food delivery.</p><p name="330d" id="330d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Adjacent networks, or smaller, frictional networks alongside expansive atomic networks, play a pivotal role in sustaining growth. For platforms like Instagram, tapping into these networks might mean enticing middle-aged users or expanding to different device ecosystems.</p><figure name="1fe9" id="1fe9" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*zg1FTT2o-7bv8M77" data-width="1406" data-height="811" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*zg1FTT2o-7bv8M77"><figcaption class="imageCaption">How eBay responded to oversaturation ? A visual story. Saturation from core auction biz was overcome by growth in fixed-price-sale biz and internationalization</figcaption></figure><p name="0ba9" id="0ba9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Tech Advantage</strong> Chen also underscores the indispensable role of technology, especially AI, in scaling network-centric companies. Challenges like pirated content on file-sharing platforms or safety concerns with services like Uber necessitate tech-driven solutions. Platforms need robust fraud detection mechanisms, spam filters, and other tools to ensure network health and minimize user attrition.</p><p name="7aaa" id="7aaa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A notable case study in the book is YouTube’s acquisition by Google. YouTube’s meteoric rise was fueled by features like its recommendation engine, search optimization, real-time translation, and video transcription. By connecting users to high-quality content, YouTube effectively sidestepped the overcrowding issue, ensuring sustained user engagement.</p><p name="085d" id="085d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Final Thoughts</strong> “The Cold Start Problem” is more than just a book — it’s a masterclass for anyone in the tech industry eager to understand the blueprint of building a successful startup from scratch. If you’ve delved into its pages, I’d love to hear your thoughts. Which insights resonated with you? Were there any ‘aha’ moments that stood out?</p><h4 name="85d6" id="85d6" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Quotable quotes from the book</strong></h4><blockquote name="bca9" id="bca9" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--h4"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">on instagrams growth — </em></strong>Come for the tool, stay for the network</blockquote><blockquote name="64eb" id="64eb" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--blockquote">“While photo filters kicked off Instagram’s rise, it would not sustain. Similarly, over time, the “tool” part of the product — the photo filters — have waned in importance, as users often post photos with the “#nofilter” tag. A recent analysis has shown that the vast majority of photos — 82 percent39 — had no filter used at all. Eight years after its initial launch, network effects had fully taken over for the utility of photo editing — it’s more network, and less tool. Looking backward, this is widely seen as one of the best tech acquisitions in history, as Instagram would likely be worth several hundred billion as a stand-alone entity. It has more than a billion active users and generates $20 billion in revenue as part of Facebook. Not bad.”</blockquote><p name="d5af" id="d5af" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">On <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">youtube’s</strong> atomic network</p><blockquote name="cf43" id="cf43" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">That’s right, YouTube started out as a dating site, where people could upload videos of themselves as part of a profile.</blockquote><p name="d425" id="d425" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">On <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">moat</strong> with POV on investing from Warren Buffet</p><blockquote name="cd2d" id="cd2d" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p graf--trailing">Because Buffett generally invests in low-tech companies like See’s Candies or Coca-Cola, the moat he refers to is often a strong brand or a unique business model. For software products with network effects, a strong moat means something different: how much effort, time, and capital does it take to replicate a product’s features and its network?</blockquote></div></div></section>
