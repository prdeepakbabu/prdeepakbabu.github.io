Steps for Next Time
Ensure you’re on the "add_papers" branch:
If you’re not already on it, switch to it:
bash

git checkout add_papers

If you deleted the branch previously and need to recreate it, start from the main branch and create it again:
bash

git checkout main
git checkout -b add_papers

Make and commit your changes:
After making your changes, stage and commit them:
bash

git add .
git commit -m "Describe your new changes here"

Switch to the main branch:
bash

git checkout main

Pull the latest changes from main (if working with a remote repository):
Before merging, ensure your local main branch is up to date with the remote:
bash

git pull origin main

This avoids potential conflicts if others have updated the main branch.

Merge "add_papers" into main:
bash

git merge add_papers

If there are no conflicts, the merge will complete automatically.

If conflicts arise, resolve them manually in the affected files, then:
bash

git add <file(s)>
git commit

Push the updated main branch to the remote repository:
bash

git push origin main

(Optional) Delete the "add_papers" branch:
If you’re done with it again:
bash

git branch -d add_papers
git push origin --delete add_papers

Quick Workflow for Future Changes
Assuming the branch exists and you’re just adding more changes:
bash

git checkout add_papers
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge add_papers
git push origin main
